<p>   < Theme Mode : Holi Dhamaka >  </p>

New Starting Island and Sky Island are coming to Erangel after the 1.9.0 update.

Experience the awesome Starting Islands! You can play the Holi Dhamaka Theme Mode by tapping the arrow button on the right bottom of Erangel and Livik under the “Ranked” tab.

<p>   < Holi Dhamaka : Sky Island >   </p>

Sky Island will appear in Erangel and Livik. While parachuting from the plane two sky islands will appear, and they have different terrain features. One of them has a pyramid reminiscent of Egypt, and the other has a winter-themed ice castle.

Once you land on a Sky Island, your character’s face will turn into a cute circle. You can loot the coins on Sky Island and use them once you land on the ground. Sky Islands are closed once the time on the right elapses, and players on the Sky Islands fall to the ground. Of course, you also fall to the ground when you are defeated by an enemy.

On Sky Island, your character’s head grows bigger when hit by the enemy. On being defeated, your character’s head inflates to the maximum thereby floating up into the air. Teammates can save the floating player by shooting at the player. If teammates fail to save the floating player for too long, the player is finished and falls to the ground.
Fear not, you may also jump off the Sky Island to return to the ground.

<p>  < Holi Dhamaka : Vibrant Plaza/Camp >    </p>

Rainbow Plaza and Camp will appear around Erangel. New terrains, as well as new interactable entities, will appear in these zones. If you interact with those entities, crates will appear. Please note that the Army Base where you can scan locations of spawned vehicles is marked in the mini-map.

<p>  < Playground Improvement : New Racing Minigame >    </p>

A racing track has been added to the Playground. You may enjoy racing competitions with your friends, or practice driving alone on the tracks.

<p> < Classic Update : Erangel Improvement >   </p>

Revision of Sosnovka Bridge in Erangel is coming! Experience the new Sosnovka Bridge with new detours! The new spots for camping with your squads are here and you’ve got to take advantage over your enemies! The bridge connecting the military base now has a wider road and improved bunker with new pedestrian walkways added to offer more strategic combat options.
