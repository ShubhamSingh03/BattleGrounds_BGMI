We are truly excited to bring the March update to you! Hereâ€™s the schedule for distribution of the Holi Dhamaka 1.9.0 Update version on March 18th   


Please note that there is a difference in the distribution time for each platform (AOS/iOS) as shown in the schedule below. 


[Update Version Distribution] 

- AOS (Google Playstore) : March 18 (Fri) 05:30 IST to March 18 (Fri) 18:30 IST  


- iOS (Apple App Store) : March 18 (Fri) 16:00 IST  


- We recommend installing in a wi-fi environment if possible when updating as lots of mobile data can be consumed.

Thank you,
