At the end of July, we promised you that fair gameplay has always been and will be our priority. Today, we have some good news for you.


Cheaters have no place in BGMI and in order to provide a fair gameplay environment to our players, we've been taking severe measures to remove cheaters from the game.


We now have cleaned out most of the cheaters in the game, making BGMI a much more fun experience, and will continue to take whatever step is necessary to keep BGMI fair and fun.


Here's an update of what's happened since our last announcement.



Total Number of bans (Aug. 1 ~ Sept. 2)



- <b style="color:white"> Permanently banned : 2,519,692 accounts </b>



- <b style="color:orange"> Temporarily banned : 706,319 accounts </b>


Please note, that all of these is just in over a month.



We've made further and stronger efforts to make BGMI free of cheaters. Here are four steps, that we have taken and we will be doubling down on.



1. Stronger Cheat Detection and Banning Mechanism

Our systems continue to evolve as we bring near real-time ways to detect cheats and ban users employing illegal means.



2. Permabans

We had initially worked on the model that first offenders will be handed out temporary bans, but as of now, we have shifted all bans to permanent bans. There's no room for second chance now.



3. Manually verify and ban any accounts that use of promote illegal programs among high-rankers.

We are monitoring accounts that used or promoted illegal programs among high-rankers in real-time. If there's any illegal program used found, we are banning them permanently immediately.



4. Blocking YouTube channels

We are monitoring real-time in YouTube for any channels that promote illegal programs, and if found, we are blocking the channels immediately while working with YouTube.

 

Based on such measures taken, the number of accounts that are being banned have significantly increased compared to before and resulted in the decrease of the number of reports made in the game.



Before we leave, a few things for you to remember.



1. If you are using cheat tools, you will get banned eventually, if not immediately.



2. Don't share your accounts with anyone. Apart from the obvious implication of losing your social media access, it might be used to test cheat tools, and your account will be banned.



3. Keep reporting - We sometimes take time due to the sheer number of reports, but we do eventually take action after proper consideration.



4. Doesn't matter if you have spent UC, or have not been detected earlier, or if you have a social media presence, if you cheat or use cheating tools (or have used in the past) you will be handed a permanent ban.



Lastly, an amazing round of thanks to all of you who play BGMI, and support us on our social media. It means a lot. We have come a long way in the past month in removing cheaters, and we want to thank you for the countless reports and support you've shown us along the way.


Thank you,
